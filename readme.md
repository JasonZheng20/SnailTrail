## Phaser Goldilocks Template

Getting a good starting structure with Phaser isn't the easyiest thing to do until now! Access Phaser, Phaser.game, states, and all the goodness with `this.whatever`. 

  - open the node commdn line or a terminal session
  - Change directory to the Phaser Goldilocks Template
  - Use `npm install` command to download required files
  - Use the command `grunt` to the web server. A browser window should open
  - Start making changes in src/game/js
  
Remember to update the Phaser library as it must be out of date by the time you use this.
